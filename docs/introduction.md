This project proposes a modern version of the Tetris game. Besides adapting it to support multiplayer game modes, the user(s) will be able to use natural I/O devices and interaction methods, such as: gestural, audio, (pseudo-)haptic, locomotion or plain old ones (i.e. keyboard, mouse). After achieving a high-score, the user will have the possibility to share it with his peers using social networks as a distribution medium.

The purpose of this wiki is to document the project development. In section 2, Project Identity the main elements that form the brand of the project will be described; this will include: logo, color schemes, typography as well as conceptual associations and emotional reactions. Section 3, Product Objectives, takes a more pragmatic approach, presenting the business goals. Section 4, User Needs, presents the segments of users we are designing the application for using the concept of (Pseudo-) Personas. Section 5, Questions, Options, and Criteria documents part of the decisions made when designing the system. Complementing, section 5, in section 6 Design Ideas, will present some of the ideas/concepts regarding the project design (i.e. sketches, wireframes, storyboards, prototypes and design patterns).
