### Sketches
Sketches were to made in order to point out the major ideas and directions for this project.
The most important questions that we wanted to answer were what are the inputs and controls for the game, how is the game board going to look like and what power ups we are going to use and how to they work.

#### Input and controls
We have decided that the game is going to be controlled with multiple devices. You don't have to tick any check-box just play either with a keyboard and mouse, game controller or a LEAP Motion controller.
With every device you can control left-right direction of a falling piece, rotate it and drop in place if you have made up your mind.
Below you can see the sketches for this interactions:

#### Board style
Since TeTwix uses two falling pieces the game board needed to adapt this feature. We came up with 3 styles:

##### Single
![](https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix/blob/master/wiki-resources/images/gameboards/gameboard-single-sketch.jpg)

In a game with a single style board, players will receive points by clearing lines that are filled from left to right. Pieces can flow freely so that the piece that falls from the right can be places on the left of the board and vice-verse and all the available power ups can be used.

##### Single
![](https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix/blob/master/wiki-resources/images/gameboards/gameboard-split-sketch.jpg)


In a game with a split style board, players will receive point when they clear a line on the same level in both of the sides. Pieces can't pass from one side to another. Not all power ups will be available and those that are can be used only in corresponding side.

##### Model
![](https://github.com/danielamariei/tetwix/blob/master/wiki-resources/images/gameboards/gameboard-model-sketch.jpg)

In a game with a model style board, players will receive points in regards to how well they match the given model and a minimum percentage is required to pass to the next level. Pieces can be moved freely on the board and all power ups are available.
