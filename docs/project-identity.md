### Project Identity
In this section we will describe the main factors that build the identity of our project; this includes: a logo for our project, some color schemes that our application will use, typography, conceptual associations made by the users of our application and the emotional reactions they have with respect to it.

#### Name & Logo
We started out to create a collaborative Tetris game and we where inspired by the famous chocolate double-bar, Twix.

#### Color Scheme

The general color scheme of out games was a colorful Tetris theme found at http://goo.gl/ezmiVD. We have combine this with shades of gray in order to have a balanced palette.

#### Typography
The project uses the Gautami typeface (font-family) which gives a nice straight look that matches the Tetris pieces.

#### Creative process
We went through a couple of propositions before we have reached this final version. Below you can see some sketches for the project logo.

####  Conceptual Association and Emotional Reactions
One of the first associations we want the users to make with respect to our application is spending time in family, while having fun -- emotional reactions. We want to promote our application as one that can be used as a mean of having fun in family, where parents and children form teams in order to make a high-score, or play one against another. This will enable family members to bond, while having fun within the comfort of their homes.

Another associations we want our users to make is technologically advanced. Our purpose is to make them emotionally interested and curios. This desiderate will be obtained through the use of natural interaction methods (e.g. gestural, locomotion, audio etc.).
