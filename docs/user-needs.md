### User Needs
#### Cognitive Processing
When talking about users, the most important aspect to take in account is their goals, which in essence is what motivates them. The goals of the users are in direct correspondence their cognitive processes. And since there are three types of user goals, there will also be three levels of cognitive processing. This is a key process which we need to take into account, revealing what could the goals, emotions and experiences be for our users.

#### Experience goals (visceral cognitive processing)
In this level the user is directly concerned with what stimulants our application has -- the sensory aspects of the application. This entails making rapid decision about what is good, bad, safe or dangerous. In order to satisfy his experience needs, we need to make the user feel smart, cool and likewise to remain focused and in control when using our application.

The part of the application that achieves all of this desiderates is the central gameplay, where users need to control pieces, make rapid decisions and simultaneously have fun. In order the be sure we meet this requirements, special considerations need to be made in order for the gameplay to provide the right experience.

#### End goals (behavioral cognitive processing)
At this level, the user manages simple, everyday behaviors. We need to define the user’s motivations for performing the tasks associated with out product. Such example include: spending quality time with family members and relaxation.

#### Life goals (reflective cognitive processing)
At this, final level, the user consciously takes into consideration and reflects upon past experience; we need to be able to support a person’s long time desires and motivation, causing it to connect with our product. Such desires could be: popularity, respect of peers, attractiveness. In order to support such desiderates, our application will enable the user to share his high-scores with his peers using social networks as a distribution medium.

#### (Pseudo-)Personas
In order to better understand the needs of the people we are designing the system for, we will break the audience into smaller groups (segments). These (pseudo-)personas will identify significant behavior patterns while synthesizing the most relevant goals and characteristics the users that belong into a certain segment have.Keeping them in mind will help us make rational and informed decisions at every step of the project development process.
