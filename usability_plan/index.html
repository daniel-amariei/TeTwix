				</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>The user plays a game for the first time using one or more interaction methods. After finishing the game, the user shares his score using the Facebook social network.</p>
            <p>The general flow of the scenario is described by the following steps: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                <p>The user goes to the web page and opens the game on his laptop;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>The application detects and displays all the input devices that are connected, and from which it can receive input;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>The user selects the option to start a new game;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>A splash screen appears informing the users that he can watch a demo regarding how to play the game;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>The user approves and he watches the demo;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>After learning how to play the game, they proceed and start controlling tetris pieces;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>When the game finally ends, the user is prompted a menu from which he selects the option to share the score using the Facebook social network.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestDetails">
			<div class="detailsLeft">
				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>Start a new game: <span><strong>20 seconds</strong></span>;</li>
						<li>Play the game using the gestural interface: <span><strong>5 minutes</strong></span>;</li>
						<li>Play the game using the <i>step interface</i> (MakeyMakey): <span><strong>5 minutes</strong></span>;</li>
						<li>Restart the game: <span><strong>20 seconds</strong></span>;</li>
                        <li>Pause and then resume the game: <span><strong>30 seconds</strong></span>;</li>
                        <li>Play a game until it ends and share the score using the Facebook social network: <strong>1 minute</strong>;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is a problem. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>			
					<ol>
						<li>What do you think about the color palette used for the tetris pieces (tetriminos)?</li>
						<li>What are the aspects that you <strong>like</strong> regarding the visual design?</li>
						<li>What are the aspects that you <strong>dislike</strong> regarding the visual design?</li>
                        <li>How would you improve the visual design?</li>
						<li>What is the <strong>easiest</strong> interaction method with the application?</li>
                        <!--<li>What is the <strong>hardest</strong> interaction method with the application?</li>-->
                        <li>What other methods of interaction would you be interested in?</li>
                        <li>What other social networks are of interest to you?</li>
                        <li>What would you change about the gaming experience?</li>
                        <li>Would you play the game again?</li>
                        <li>Would you play the game with you family or friends to have fun?</li>
                        <li>What is the gesture used in order to <strong>rotate</strong> a piece in the game using the gestural interface?</li>
                        <li>What is the gesture used in order to <strong>move left</strong> a piece in the game using the gestural interface?</li>
                        
                    </ol>

				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
                    <li>You might explain how usability testing is part of the design and development process. Emphasize that the system is being tested, not them and not you. You are trying to understand how the system would work in their environment. (It's not very helpful if they are trying to imagine how other people would use the system; ask them to test the system for themselves.) It may be helpful to give some examples of how a usability test can improve a system (e.g., show how it gives confusing or contradictory signals, how too many or too few things are supposed to happen at once, or how specific assumptions about the users' knowledge and skills may or may not be true, etc.);</li>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio);</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?";</li>
                    <li>Thank the usability subject for taking the time to help you to improve the system. Emphasize how the knowledge you gain from this process will be used to make a more usable system. You might describe how much change is really possible at this point: are you testing an early prototype or a beta release? In other words, can features be added or are you just fixing bugs? </li>

		</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestResultsInfo">
		<h4>Summary</h4>

			<li>2/4 users were a little confused about the meaning of the icons on the menu;</li>
	        <li>2/4 users found the color palette a bit confusing;</li>
            <li>2/4 users had problems predicting the trajectory of the piece; maybe the border is appropriate (A/B testing is required in order to decide which option is better);</li>
			<li>1/4 users did not found the Facebook score sharing functionality obvious.</li>
